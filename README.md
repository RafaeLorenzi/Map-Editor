# Map-Editor
Simple pixel editor that could save and load files.

_The Idea

Using the Simple GFX library developed at <Academia de CÃ³digo_> the challenge was to create a simple pixel editor that could save and load files.

_The Development

The program works based on a grid implemented with a bi-dimensional array. Each position on the array is capable of storing a certain state: painted, color, hovered, etc. It works with the keyboard. The save file registers each active cell state. The load files allows to recover a certain saved grid state.
